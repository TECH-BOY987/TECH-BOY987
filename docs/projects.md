# PROJECTS


## 1x3 Router design [ [link] ](https://github.com/TECH-BOY987/codes/tree/main/verilog/router_project) <br>

1. **Router Architecture and Design:** Develop a concise and efficient 1x3 router architecture using Verilog, outlining the structure of input and output ports and the logic for data packet routing.

2. **Verilog Implementation:** Code the router's functionality in Verilog, translating the architectural design into executable hardware description language that accurately represents the desired behavior of the 1x3 router.

3. **Testing and Validation:** Create a comprehensive testbench to validate the router's performance under various conditions, ensuring correct packet routing, error handling, and proper functioning of the implemented design.

4. **Performance Analysis:** Conduct thorough performance analysis, evaluating the router's throughput, latency, and efficiency. Optimize the design to enhance these metrics, addressing any identified bottlenecks or areas for improvement.


## Protocol Verification projects 

1. **AHB to APB BRIDGE:** [ [link] ](https://github.com/TECH-BOY987/codes/tree/main/APB) <br>
   The AHB to APB bridge is a crucial component in embedded systems, seamlessly connecting the high-performance Advanced High-Performance Bus (AHB) with the more peripheral-oriented Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB).
   Serving as a translator, it efficiently manages data transfer between these buses, optimizing communication between core processors and peripheral devices.
   This bridge ensures a smooth and synchronized flow of data, enhancing overall system performance and allowing for streamlined integration of diverse hardware components.
   Its role is pivotal in maintaining a balanced and efficient data exchange within complex embedded systems.

2. **UART:** [ [link] ]( ) <br>
   Performing verification experiments for UART communication protocol, ensuring accurate and reliable serial communication. The experiments cover baud rate settings, start/stop bit handling, and error detection mechanisms, validating the protocol's robustness and compatibility for asynchronous data transmission.

3. **AMBA:** <br>
   Conducting comprehensive verification experiments for the AMBA communication protocol, encompassing AHB and APB bus architectures. The experiments focus on verifying proper data transfer, bus arbitration, and protocol compliance, ensuring seamless integration and communication between AMBA-compliant components.
